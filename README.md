## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

It was my first experience working with Flexbox, although I still don't feel comfortable with it, it's a good start.

```css
 body {
        margin: 0;
        padding: 0;
        display: flex;
        flex-direction: column;
        justify-content: center;
        align-items: center;
        min-height: 100vh;
        font-family: "Outfit", sans-serif;
        background-color: hsl(212, 45%, 89%);
      }
```

### Continued development

- Using Flexbox
- I want to learn more about React/Angular and also use them in future challenges
